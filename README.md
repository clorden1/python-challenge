This code was written by me, Connor Lorden, with the help of the following sources. Each source is referenced in the
comments of each .py file where it was used

#1: This source was used to subtract an element of a list by the previous element of that list. It was used in determining 
the change of profits between months in the PyBank analysis.

#2: This was used to find operators to take a variable and assign the new value of that variable to itself plus 1. This was 
used in both the PyPoll analysis to determine the counnt of votes for each candidate.

#3: This source was used to find an operation the returns a list of all unique values of another list. It was used in the PyPoll
analysis to determine all the candidates who recieved votes.

#4: This source was used to find syntax to print multiple lines within the same print statement. It was used in both PyPoll and
PyBank analyses to print reuslts to the terminal and to a .txt in PyPoll and to  a .txt in PyBank
